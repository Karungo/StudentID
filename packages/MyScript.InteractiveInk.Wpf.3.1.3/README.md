# MyScript Interactive Ink SDK runtime libraries for WPF

Interactive Ink extends digital ink to allow users to more intuitively create, interact with, and share content in digital form.

Handwritten text, mathematical equations or even diagrams are interpreted in real-time to be editable via simple gestures, responsive and easy to convert to a neat output.

This nuget speeds up the integration of those rich features into your application.
